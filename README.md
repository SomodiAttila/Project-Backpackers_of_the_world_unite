# Project-Customer_analysis
A project diving into the data of a fictional travel guide startup.

## Goal of the project
The goal of this analysis is to help a fictional startup get more information about its customers to improve decision making.

The project seeks the answers for these questions:
1. In **which country** should the startup prioritise its effort and why?
2. Any advice on how to be **smart with its investments** based on the data from the last 3 months?
3. Is there **interesting information** (beyond the above 2 questions) in the data from which the startup could profit?

## Introduction

Dilan is a world traveler and a solo entrepreneur. He writes a travel blog where he sells info products: a $8 e-book (World Travelers' Best Practices) and a $80 video course (How To Travel the World).

- On his blog he has thousands of readers every day, coming from three sources: Reddit, SEO and AdWords.

- Dilan writes about his travel experiences covering the 6 main continents of the planet - these are the main categories on the blog.

**The business strategy is simple:**

New readers visit the blog.
They read articles.
They subscribe to the newsletter.
They purchase the info products.

- Dilan's travel blog is available in 8 (and only 8) different countries.

- The marketing budget is not too high at the moment: Dilan spends only ~$1000 a month combined:

  1. for Adwords advertisement (~$500 a month for paid ads),
  2. for SEO (~$250 a month for editing) and
  3. for Reddit (~$250 for content creation)
 
- He wants to invest more (time, work and money). But how to do that the most efficiently? What should he focus on?
## Data

The dataset for this project is the ***raw user activity*** data from Dilan's blog between 1 January 2018 and 31 March 2018. It's a log with ~600.000 rows.

## Approach

I used EDA techniques to explore the dataset and try to **visualize** every bit of information that seemed promising.
I tried to focus on these topics:
- How are the **daily activity/customers/revenue** metrics?
- How much of the revenue is generated by each product?
- What is the **funnel** of the company like?
- Does the **country analysis** tell me something?
- Does the **source analysis** tell me something?
- Does the **topic analysis** tell me something?
- What are the **most profitable segments**?

I also used a **random forest model** to see which features can give me the most predictive power about **readers turning into customers**.

## Results

I expound the results in great detail in my presentation, which you can find in the repository of the project.
